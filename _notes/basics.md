# Intro

Hi everyone, I'm Henry.

In this video, I'm going to be going over the basics of Turtles, Java, and what
I plan to accomplish through this video and future videos.

All material (sketches, code, my script) will be linked below.

# What's a turtle?

The shortest description I can come up with is, "A little robot with a pen taped
to it that runs around."

A [turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics), or, more
specifically, 'turtle graphics', refers to a little controllable robot with a
pen...taped to it that runs around on a 2d grid.

It has a list of attributes, like pen color and (x,y) position, as well as a
list of methods that it can perform, like turning and going forward.

Attributes:
- Pen
  - Color
  - Width
- Turtle
  - Position
  - Rotation

...and that's it! Any manipulation of the landscape below the turtle is done by
telling the turtle to run around, lift its pen up and down, and change pen
colors and thicknesses.

# What's Java?

Aside from being a heavenly breakfast drink from the gods, Java is a programming
language.

More simply, it's an abstract way to tell your computer to do stuff.

I won't get info the fancy worded details like "multiple typing" and "static
inheritance" because we don't need to know them to tell a reptile to draw
shapes.

## Can I drink it?

Yes, yes you can.

# Why turtles?

I wanted to do turtles instead of discussing 'bare' concepts, like loops and
other programming constructs.

I want to present a way to think about drawing shapes that is completely
implementation-agnostic.

I feel that giving people the tools to turn little math mini-conjectures and
just ideas into code instead of *starting with code* is easier for people to
remember and latch on to.

And remeber, I don't want your knowledge of coding to be a requisite for
watching these videos, at least not at first.

## Why not make a program that, like, does your taxes?

- That's boring!
- I find people learn more from _interactive_ demonstrations
- When you mess up the taxes program, you don't really get visceral, intuitive 
  feedback about what your error was.

  When you, for example, make a stroke twice as long as it should be, then your
  happy face you were trying to draw is stretched out, but it's much easier to
  see, and quicker to figure out. (assuming it compiles)
  
# Why Java?

## Can I do this in Python? C? Lisp?
